## Example (Kenyan context)
> A Nairobi-based analyst increased promotion chances by **30%**...active performance review documentation and skill certification.

## Checklist
- [ ] Localised examples and terminology  
- [ ] Outcome-first bullet structure  
- [ ] Metrics and proof points  
- [ ] Simple, clean writing and PDF-ready presentation

**Tip:** Every career action should have measurable outcomes in **KES** or time saved.

## Why most career switches lead to pay cuts

Common problems:

- People switch reactively out of frustration, not strategy.  
- They enter junior roles in new fields because they can’t prove value at their current level.  
- They don’t map existing skills to the target industry.

To avoid a pay cut, your move must be **positioned as a lateral or upward move in value**, even if the title changes.

## Clarify your “from–to” move

Define clearly:

- **From:** current role, title, skills, industry.  
- **To:** target role, title(s), skills, industry.

Examples:

- From: Accountant in manufacturing → To: Financial analyst in fintech.  
- From: Admin officer → To: Operations coordinator / project assistant in tech or NGO.

If you’re vague, recruiters will be vague with offers.

## Map transferable skills

List your current skills under:

- Technical (tools, systems, processes).  
- Business (budgeting, reporting, analysis, planning).  
- People (communication, stakeholder management, negotiation).

Then map them to the target role:

- “My experience preparing management accounts → strong base for financial analysis.”  
- “My operations coordination work → strong skill set for project coordination.”

Document this mapping. It feeds into your CV, cover letters, and interview answers.

## Close the skill gap strategically

You don’t need 100% of the target skills to switch.

Focus on:

- 2–3 core tools or methods the new field requires (e.g. SQL, Power BI, project management frameworks).  
- 1–2 recognisable certifications or courses that signal seriousness.  
- 1–3 small portfolio pieces (dashboards, reports, process maps, case studies).

Target 60–70% readiness, then move.

## Position your CV for a lateral move, not a downgrade

Key changes:

- Reorder your achievements to highlight skills relevant to the target field.  
- Use a summary at the top that states:

  > “Operations Officer transitioning into Project Coordination – 4+ years managing timelines, vendors, and cross-team delivery.”

- Remove or compress experience that doesn’t support your target direction.

Recruiters must see **alignment**, not confusion.

## Use internal transitions to protect pay

If possible, switch **within** your current company:

- Talk to trusted managers about your interest in another function.  
- Volunteer to support cross-functional projects.  
- Ask to be seconded or assigned partially to the new area.

Internal switches:

- Reduce risk for both sides.  
- Are more likely to maintain or increase your pay.

## Negotiating without losing ground

When offers come in:

- Don’t rush to accept the first number.  
- Anchor your negotiation on:

  - Market salary data for the target role.  
  - Your current compensation.  
  - The fact that you are not an entry-level fresh switcher, but a lateral mover with proven experience.

Phrases to use:

> “Given my X years of experience doing Y, and the scope of this role, I was expecting a range closer to KES A–B.”

> “I’m excited about this switch and I’m keen that the move remains neutral or positive financially.”

## Temporary sacrifices vs. permanent downgrades

Sometimes, a short-term step back can lead to a bigger step forward, but that must be **intentional**.

Accept a lower salary only if:

- There is a clear, realistic path to higher pay within 12–24 months.  
- You are entering a field with strong long-term earning potential.  
- You have the financial runway to absorb the temporary dip.

Otherwise, protect your floor.

## Build a 6–12 month transition plan

Your plan should include:

- Monthly targets for applications and conversations.  
- Skills to learn and portfolio pieces to create.  
- Financial buffer milestones (savings, side income, debt reduction).

Review progress every month and adjust.

A well-executed career switch in Kenya does not have to come with a salary cut. With the right mapping, preparation, and positioning, you can move sideways or upwards — in both role quality and pay.

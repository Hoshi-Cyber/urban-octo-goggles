## Outcome in 30 seconds
See how to transform weak task bullets into quantified outcomes recruiters prefer.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: numbers first
Lead with the metric. Keep verbs simple. Use **KES** and %.

### Signal 2: scope and tool
Name the system, scale, or region to demonstrate complexity.

## Steps

### Step 1: pick a weak bullet
Before: “Handled supplier invoices.”

### Step 2: rewrite with metric
After: “Processed **1,200** supplier invoices/month with **99.8%** accuracy; cut late fees **KES 320K**.”

## Table: six role families, before → after

| Role             | Before                   | After                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Finance          | “Managed petty cash”     | “Digitised petty cash **KES 500K**/mo; cut recon time **40%**.”                               |
| Sales            | “Talked to clients”      | “Closed **KES 18M** ARR; **+22%** win-rate via 3-step demo flow.”                             |
| Ops              | “Coordinated deliveries” | “Raised OTIF **81% → 93%** via route batching and vendor scorecards.”                         |
| IT               | “Maintained systems”     | “Cut downtime **35%**; MTTR **3h → 1.9h** across 120 nodes.”                                  |
| HR               | “Handled onboarding”     | “Reduced time-to-productivity **25%** with 7-day preboarding and LMS playbooks.”              |
| Customer Support | “Resolved tickets”       | “Improved FCR **+14pp**; CSAT **4.6/5** on 2,400 tickets/quarter.”                            |

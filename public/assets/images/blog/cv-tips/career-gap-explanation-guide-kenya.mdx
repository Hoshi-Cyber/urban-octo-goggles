## Overview
Career gaps aren’t disqualifiers if framed as periods of growth, learning, or transition. Kenyan recruiters respond to honest, confident narratives.

### Examples
- **Skill upgrade:** “2023–2024: Completed data analytics certification and freelanced short projects.”  
- **Personal:** “2022: Family care period; resumed career via part-time remote support roles.”  
- **Entrepreneurship:** “2021: Operated small online business; developed marketing and accounting skills.”

**Tip:** Frame in terms of value regained, not excuses made.

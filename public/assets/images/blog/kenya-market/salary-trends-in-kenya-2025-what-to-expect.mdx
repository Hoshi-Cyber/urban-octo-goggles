## Summary

Inflation stabilised below **5%** mid-2025, but wage growth remains uneven. Tech and healthcare lead, while manufacturing and NGOs hold steady.

| Sector | Average YoY Change | Median monthly pay (KES) |
| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Fintech & digital | +9 % | 230 000 |
| Healthcare | +8 % | 180 000 |
| Logistics | +6 % | 150 000 |
| Manufacturing | +3 % | 120 000 |

### Drivers
- Talent shortages in software, compliance, data.  
- Remote opportunities raising local salary expectations.  
- Strong shilling temporarily flattening USD-denominated pay.

### Tips
Benchmark using at least two sources (BrighterMonday, Fuzu, firm reports). Negotiate benefits—health, data, learning budget—as part of total compensation.

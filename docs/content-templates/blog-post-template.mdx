> **Summary:** This guide shows you how to structure, keyword, and format your CV so it parses cleanly in modern Applicant Tracking Systems without sacrificing human readability.

## Structure first
Use a single-column layout with clear section headings: **Summary**, **Experience**, **Skills**, **Education**.
Avoid tables, text boxes, or multi-column grids that break parsing.

## Keywords with intent
Derive keywords from the role spec. Mirror exact phrasing in **Experience** bullets where truthful.
Avoid keyword dumps in a separate block that ATS may discount.

## Bullets that prove impact
Each bullet: *action* → *scope* → *metric* → *outcome*.
Example: “Reduced average time-to-offer from 32 to 18 days by restructuring screening rubric.”

## Skills that map to the role
Keep a concise, role-aligned skills section. Prefer concrete skills over vague traits.

## File hygiene
Export as **PDF** unless employer mandates DOCX. Keep text selectable, not scanned images.
Use a standard font, 10.5–12pt, and accessible contrast.

### Quick checklist
- Headings are plain text and consistent.
- No images for text, no decorative icons.
- Dates use a consistent format: `MMM YYYY – MMM YYYY`.
- Location and role titles are unambiguous.
- Links are clean and optional.

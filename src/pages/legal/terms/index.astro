          Full details of each service or package (including deliverables, number of revisions and the general
          process) are set out on our website or in written proposals or invoices we send you. We may update, modify

        id="ordering-process"
        heading="4. Ordering process and service delivery"
      >
        <p>In general, our ordering and delivery process works as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>4.1</strong> You review our services and packages on our website or via a custom proposal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4.2</strong> You place an order or confirm acceptance of a proposal (usually in writing via email,
            form or messaging).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4.3</strong> We confirm the service scope, price and any key timelines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4.4</strong> You make payment in full (unless otherwise agreed in writing).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4.5</strong> You complete an intake form and/or send us your existing CV and other relevant
            information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4.6</strong> We review your information, create or refine your documents, and deliver drafts by
            email or another agreed method.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4.7</strong> You provide feedback within the agreed revision timeframe and we carry out the
            included revision rounds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4.8</strong> We deliver final documents once revisions are complete or the revision window has
            expired.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Our services are delivered digitally. We do not usually offer in-person consultations or physical document
          delivery. Any timelines we provide are good-faith estimates and depend on factors such as your
          responsiveness, the complexity of your profile and our workload at the time.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection
        id="client-responsibilities"
        heading="5. Your responsibilities"

        <p>You are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>a)</strong> Providing accurate, complete and truthful information about your work history,
            education, skills and achievements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>b)</strong> Carefully reviewing drafts to ensure they correctly reflect your background and informing
            us promptly of any errors or changes needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>c)</strong> Responding to our questions, clarification requests and draft documents within a
            reasonable timeframe so we can deliver the service efficiently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>d)</strong> Keeping copies of all final documents we deliver to you and using them responsibly with
            employers and third parties.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You remain solely responsible for the truthfulness of all information in your CV and other documents. We
          will not knowingly include false or misleading information and may refuse requests that would require us to
          do so. We may decline or terminate services where information provided is clearly false, misleading or
          incompatible with our professional standards; in such cases, refunds are handled in line with our Refund
          &amp; Revisions Policy.

      <LegalSection
        id="pricing-and-payments"
        heading="6. Pricing, payment and taxes"
      >
        <p>
          Current prices for standard packages are displayed on our website or provided in specific quotations. We
          reserve the right to change prices at any time for future orders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise stated, all fees are payable in our primary operating currency (for example, Kenyan
          Shillings (KES)). Payment is typically required in full before work begins, unless we have agreed
          alternative terms in writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may use third-party payment processors (for example, card, mobile money or online payment platforms).
          By making a payment, you may also be subject to the terms and privacy policies of those providers. If a
          payment is reversed, charged back or cancelled after work has started, we may suspend or terminate services
          and reserve the right to recover amounts due for work already completed.
        </p>

      <LegalSection
        id="delivery-and-communication"
        heading="7. Service delivery, timelines and communication"
      >
        <p>
          We aim to deliver drafts and final documents within the timeframes discussed with you. These timeframes are
          estimates and depend on your responsiveness, the complexity of your profile and workload at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will communicate with you primarily via email and, where agreed, other digital channels such as
          WhatsApp or online meeting tools. If you require work by a specific deadline, you must clearly communicate
          this before purchasing the service. We will confirm whether the deadline is realistic and may charge a rush
          or priority fee where appropriate.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="revisions" heading="8. Revisions">
        <p>
          Each service or package includes a defined number of revision rounds and a revision timeframe, as stated
          on our website or in your specific proposal. Revisions are intended to refine and improve the documents
          based on your feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typical revisions include clarifying responsibilities and achievements, adjusting wording and tone,
          reordering sections and making minor adjustments within the same general role/industry and seniority
          level. Revisions are not intended to cover fundamental changes in scope, such as switching to a completely
          different role or industry, or moving from entry-level to executive-level targeting. Such requests may be
          treated as a new service or an upgrade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Revision rounds must be used within the stated timeframe from the date of first draft delivery, unless we
          agree otherwise in writing. If the revision window expires without feedback, the project may be considered
          complete and closed.

        id="refunds-and-cancellations"
        heading="9. Refunds and cancellations"
      >
        <p>
          Because our services involve personalised professional work, refunds are limited and depend on the stage of
          the project at the time you request a refund. In general, once substantive work has started or drafts have
          been delivered, monetary refunds are restricted and we focus on revisions and, where appropriate, service
          credits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our detailed framework for refunds, cancellations, partial credits and project closure is set out in the{" "}

        <p>
          We aim to improve the quality and presentation of your CV and related documents and to support your career
          goals. However, we do not and cannot guarantee specific outcomes such as job offers, interviews,
          promotions or salary increases, as these depend on factors beyond our control.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for how you apply, interview and manage your career decisions. Our role is to support
          and present your information professionally, not to act as a recruiter or employer.

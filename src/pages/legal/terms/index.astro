        </p>

        <h2 id="pricing-and-payments">6. Pricing and payments</h2>
        <p>
          Prices are displayed on cvwriting.co.ke or in written proposals. Payment is due in full upfront unless
          otherwise agreed. Accepted payment methods may include mobile money, card payments, or bank transfer,
          processed through third-party providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          All fees are in Kenyan Shillings (KES) unless stated otherwise and may be subject to applicable taxes.
          If your payment is reversed or disputed without valid reason, we may suspend ongoing work and restrict
          future access to our services.
        </p>

        <h2 id="delivery-timelines">7. Delivery timelines</h2>
        <p>
          We aim to meet the turnaround times indicated on our website or agreed in writing. Timelines may be
          adjusted if you delay in providing information or feedback, if we agree to additional services or major
          changes mid-project, or if there are unforeseen events outside our reasonable control. We will communicate
          changes to timelines promptly.
        </p>

        <h2 id="revisions">8. Revisions</h2>
        <p>
          Each package includes a specified number of revision rounds and a defined revision window (for example,
          up to 2–3 rounds within 7–14 days of first draft delivery). Revisions are intended for clarifying
          information, adjusting tone or emphasis, and refining structure and content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Revisions are not intended for completely changing your role, industry, or seniority target (which may
          require an upgraded service), or for frequent, ongoing tweaks beyond the agreed period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specific revision rules are detailed in our Refund &amp; Revisions Policy, which is incorporated into
          these Terms by reference.
        </p>

        <h2 id="refunds-and-credits">9. Refunds and credits</h2>
        <p>
          Our approach to refunds and credits is defined in the Refund &amp; Revisions Policy – CVWriting.co.ke
          (Kenya). Refund eligibility depends on the stage of your project. Once the first draft is delivered,
          monetary refunds are generally not available; we focus on revisions and, where appropriate, credits. We
          do not offer refunds based on job outcomes.
        </p>

        <h2 id="no-guarantee-of-employment">10. No guarantee of employment or outcomes</h2>
        <p>
          We aim to significantly improve the quality and presentation of your professional documents. However,
          we do not guarantee any job offer, interview, or recruiter response. Hiring decisions depend on many
          factors beyond our control, including market conditions, employer preferences, and your performance in
          interviews.
        </p>

        <h2 id="intellectual-property">11. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>
          You are entitled to use the final CV and related documents we produce for your personal, professional
          job search and career-related purposes. We retain intellectual property rights in our templates,
          methodologies, and proprietary frameworks. You may not resell, redistribute, or commercially exploit
          our templates or content as your own service.
        </p>
        <p>
          With your permission, we may use anonymised versions of documents as internal samples or training
          materials, with all names and identifying details removed.
        </p>

        <h2 id="acceptable-use">12. Acceptable use of the website</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the website for fraudulent, illegal, or abusive purposes.</li>
          <li>Attempt to gain unauthorised access to our systems or data.</li>
          <li>
            Interfere with the normal operation of the site (for example, via automated scraping or attacks).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may suspend or block access where we reasonably suspect misuse.
        </p>

        <h2 id="third-party-tools">13. Third-party tools and links</h2>
        <p>
          Our website may use or contain links to third-party tools or websites (for example, analytics, payment
          processors, social media, external resources). We are not responsible for the content, security, or
          privacy practices of third-party sites. Your use of such tools is governed by their own terms and policies.
        </p>

        <h2 id="limitation-of-liability">14. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by Kenyan law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental,
          consequential, or special damages (including loss of opportunity, loss of income, or reputational harm)
          arising from the use of our services or website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our total liability in connection with any service shall not exceed the amount you paid for that specific
          service. Nothing in these Terms limits liability where it cannot be excluded under applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2 id="indemnity">15. Indemnity</h2>
        <p>
          You agree to indemnify and hold harmless CVWriting.co.ke, its owners, and team members from any claims,
          losses, or expenses arising from your misuse of our services or website, your provision of inaccurate,
          misleading, or unlawful information, or your breach of these Terms.
        </p>

        <h2 id="governing-law">16. Governing law and jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Kenya. Any disputes arising out of or in
          connection with these Terms or our services that cannot be resolved amicably shall be subject to the
          exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Kenya, typically located in Nairobi.
        </p>

        <h2 id="changes-to-terms">17. Changes to these Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms periodically. The latest version will always be available on cvwriting.co.ke
          with the “Last updated” date at the top. Continued use of the website or services after changes are
          published constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>

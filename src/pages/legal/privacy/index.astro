            <strong>c)</strong> <strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> where processing is necessary for our legitimate

      <LegalSection id="sharing-of-data" heading="7. Sharing of personal data">
        <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share it with trusted third parties, including:</p>

          <li>
            <strong>a)</strong> Service providers and subcontractors (for example, experienced CV writers or editors)

          Where third parties act as data processors on our behalf, we seek to ensure appropriate contractual and

        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="international-transfers" heading="8. International data transfers">
        <p>
          Because we operate online and may use cloud-based tools, your personal data may be transferred to and
          processed in countries outside Kenya (for example, where hosting, email, backup, analytics or collaboration
          tools are located).
        </p>
        <p>
          When we transfer personal data internationally, we aim to use providers that implement appropriate security
          measures and, where applicable, contractual safeguards. We also seek to minimise transfers where possible
          and rely on reputable services with strong privacy and security standards.

      <LegalSection id="data-retention" heading="9. Data retention">
        <p>
          We retain personal data only for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this
          Policy, including to meet legal, accounting and reporting requirements.
        </p>
        <p>In general, we apply the following retention practices:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>a)</strong> CV project files and related communication: typically up to three (3) years from the
            date of last active interaction with you, to support follow-up requests and continuity if you return for
            updates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>b)</strong> Invoices, financial records and payment-related data: retained for up to seven (7) years
            or as required by applicable tax and accounting laws.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>c)</strong> Marketing contact details: retained until you unsubscribe or withdraw consent, after
            which we may keep a minimal suppression record to ensure we do not contact you again in error.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may retain certain information for longer where we have a legal obligation to do so, where necessary for
          the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or where we have a strong legitimate interest that is
          compatible with your rights and freedoms.

      <LegalSection id="security" heading="10. Security of your data">
        <p>
          We take reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect personal data against unauthorised or
          unlawful processing, and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. These measures include using
          reputable hosting and cloud service providers, restricting access to client data to those who need it for
          their role, and regularly reviewing access rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          No method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. While we
          strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect personal data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

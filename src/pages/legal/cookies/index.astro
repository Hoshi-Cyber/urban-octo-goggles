        <h2 id="what-are-cookies">1. What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They help the site remember
          your actions and preferences over time, such as login details, language, and pages visited. We also use
          similar technologies like pixels and tags (collectively, “cookies”) for analytics and marketing.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-we-use-cookies">2. How we use cookies</h2>
        <p>We use cookies on cvwriting.co.ke for the following purposes:</p>
        <p><strong>Strictly necessary cookies:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Essential for the site to function (for example, page navigation, basic security). These cookies cannot be
          switched off in our systems.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Preference cookies:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Remember your settings and choices (for example, preferred language or region, cookie preferences).
        </p>

        <p><strong>Analytics and performance cookies:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Help us understand how visitors use our website (pages visited, time spent, clicks) so we can improve
          content and usability.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Marketing and advertising cookies:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Used to deliver and measure ads, retarget visitors, or create audiences for marketing campaigns. These may
          be set by us or by third-party partners such as social media platforms or ad networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not place non-essential (analytics/marketing) cookies without your consent, where required by
          applicable regulation.
        </p>

        <h2 id="categories-of-cookies">3. Categories of cookies we use (examples)</h2>
        <p>Below is an indicative structure you can fill with actual tools and names:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong><br />
            Purpose: Load pages, manage sessions, maintain security, store cookie consent choices (for example,
            “cookieConsent”, “session_id”).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Preferences cookies</strong><br />
            Purpose: Remember your language, site customisations, and previously selected options.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics cookies</strong><br />
            Purpose: Understand website traffic and performance (for example, cookies related to Google Analytics 4
            or similar tools).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marketing cookies</strong><br />
            Purpose: Measure and improve our marketing, show relevant content or ads on other platforms (for example,
            pixels or cookies from Meta or Google Ads, where implemented).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="cookie-consent-and-preferences">4. Cookie consent and preferences</h2>
        <p>
          When you first visit cvwriting.co.ke, you may see a cookie banner that explains that we use cookies and why
          and allows you to accept all, reject non-essential, or manage preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can update your preferences at any time by visiting the “Manage Cookies” link in the footer or settings
          section of the site. From there, you can enable or disable non-essential cookie categories (for example,
          analytics, marketing) and save your preferences, which the site will remember through a consent cookie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strictly necessary cookies are always active, as the site cannot function properly without them.
        </p>

        <h2 id="managing-cookies-browser">5. Managing cookies in your browser</h2>
        <p>
          You can also manage or delete cookies directly in your browser settings. Options typically allow you to
          view cookies set on your device, block cookies from specific sites, delete existing cookies, and set rules
          for all websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Blocking or deleting certain cookies may affect your experience and prevent parts of the site from
          working as intended.
        </p>

        <h2 id="third-party-cookies">6. Third-party cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Some cookies may be placed by third parties when you interact with embedded content, analytics tools, or
          advertising or remarketing pixels. These third parties may collect data about your usage of our site and
          other websites. Their use of cookies is governed by their own privacy and cookie policies.
        </p>

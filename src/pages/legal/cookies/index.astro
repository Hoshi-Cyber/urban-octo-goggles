        <p>
          Cookies are small text files stored on your device when you visit a website. They help the site
          remember your actions and preferences over time, such as login details, language, and pages visited.
          We also use similar technologies like pixels and tags (collectively, “cookies”) for analytics and
          marketing.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="how-we-use-cookies" heading="2. How we use cookies">
        <p>
          We use cookies on CVWriting.co.ke for the following purposes:
        </p>

        <p><strong>2.1 Strictly necessary cookies:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Essential for the site to function (for example, page navigation and basic security). These cookies
          are required for core functionality and cannot be switched off in our systems.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2.2 Preference cookies:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Remember your settings and choices (for example, preferred language or region, cookie preferences).
          These help us tailor your experience.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2.3 Analytics and performance cookies:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Help us understand how visitors use our website (pages visited, time spent, clicks) so we can improve
          our content, navigation, and overall usability.
        </p>

        <p><strong>2.4 Marketing and advertising cookies:</strong></p>
        <p>
          Used to deliver and measure ads, retarget visitors, or create audiences for marketing campaigns.
          These may be set by us or by third-party partners such as social media platforms or ad networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will not place non-essential (analytics or marketing) cookies without your consent, where required
          by applicable regulation.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="categories-of-cookies" heading="3. Categories of cookies we use (examples)">
        <p>Below is an indicative structure that may be updated with specific tools and cookie names used on the site:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>3.1 Strictly necessary cookies</strong><br />
            Purpose: Load pages, manage sessions, maintain security, and store cookie consent choices (for example,
            values like “cookieConsent” or “session_id”).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3.2 Preferences cookies</strong><br />
            Purpose: Remember your language, site customisations, and previously selected options.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3.3 Analytics cookies</strong><br />
            Purpose: Understand website traffic and performance (for example, cookies related to analytics tools
            such as Google Analytics 4 or similar services).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3.4 Marketing cookies</strong><br />
            Purpose: Measure and improve our marketing, and show relevant content or ads on other platforms (for example,
            pixels or cookies from Meta or Google Ads, where implemented).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection

        heading="4. Cookie consent and preferences"
      >
        <p>
          When you first visit CVWriting.co.ke, you may see a cookie banner that explains that we use cookies,
          why we use them, and provides options to accept all, reject non-essential cookies, or manage your
          preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can update your preferences at any time by using the “Manage Cookies” link in the footer or settings
          section of the site. From there, you can enable or disable non-essential cookie categories (for example,
          analytics or marketing) and save your preferences. We store your choices in a consent cookie so that the
          site remembers them on future visits from the same browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strictly necessary cookies are always active, as the site cannot function properly without them.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection
        id="managing-cookies-browser"
        heading="5. Managing cookies in your browser"
      >
        <p>
          You can also manage or delete cookies directly in your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>a)</strong> view the cookies stored on your device;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>b)</strong> block cookies from specific websites;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>c)</strong> delete existing cookies; and
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>d)</strong> set rules for how cookies should be handled across all websites.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The steps vary by browser and device. If you block or delete certain cookies, some features of
          CVWriting.co.ke may not function correctly and your experience may be affected.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="third-party-cookies" heading="6. Third-party cookies">
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Third-party cookies are subject to the privacy and cookie policies of the third parties that set them.
          We encourage you to review those policies to understand how your data is used and how you can exercise

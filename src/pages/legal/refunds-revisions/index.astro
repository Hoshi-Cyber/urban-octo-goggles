          Purpose. This Refund &amp; Revisions Policy explains how CVWriting.co.ke ("we", "us", "our") handles refunds,
          credits, and revision requests for our CV writing and related professional services in Kenya.
        </p>

        <h2 id="core-principles">1. Core Principles</h2>

        <h3 id="service-based-offering">1.1 Service-based offering</h3>
        <p>
          Our products are professional services (CVs, cover letters, LinkedIn profiles and related documentation),
          not physical goods. Once work has started, our team invests time, expertise and research into your documents.
        </p>

        <h3 id="fairness-and-professionalism">1.2 Fairness and professionalism</h3>
        <p>
          We will reasonably consider refund or credit requests in situations where we have clearly failed to deliver
          what was agreed (scope, timelines, or quality thresholds).
        </p>

        <h3 id="outcome-neutral">1.3 Outcome-neutral</h3>
        <p>
          We cannot and do not guarantee a job, interview, or recruiter response. Refunds are not issued based on hiring
          outcomes, market conditions, or employer decisions.
        </p>

        <h2 id="stages-and-eligibility">2. Stages of Service and Refund Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          Our policy is based on clear project stages. Eligibility for a refund or credit depends on the stage your
          order is in when the request is made.
        </p>

        <h3 id="stage-1">2.1 Stage 1 – Before work starts (pre-intake)</h3>
        <p><strong>a) Definition.</strong> You have made payment, but you have not yet submitted the required information/intake form and no writer has started work.</p>
        <p><strong>b) Refund eligibility.</strong> You may request a full refund within seven (7) calendar days of payment, provided work has not started.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>c) Inactivity.</strong> If we do not receive the required information from you within thirty (30)
          calendar days of payment, the order becomes non-refundable. At our discretion, we may convert the amount paid
          into a credit that can be used within twelve (12) months for our services.
        </p>

        <h3 id="stage-2">2.2 Stage 2 – After intake but before first draft is delivered</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>a) Definition.</strong> You have submitted your information/intake form, and a writer has started
          working, but no first draft has yet been delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>b) Refund eligibility.</strong> Because substantial work typically occurs at this stage, full refunds
          are not available. In exceptional cases where we have clearly failed to meet agreed timelines or standards,
          we may offer a partial refund of up to fifty percent (50%) of the fee, subject to review.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>c) Credit option.</strong> Where a refund is not appropriate, we may offer a service credit to be
          applied to another CVWriting.co.ke service within twelve (12) months.
        </p>

        <h3 id="stage-3">2.3 Stage 3 – After first draft is delivered</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>a) Definition.</strong> You have received the first draft of your CV or related document(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>b) Refund eligibility.</strong> No monetary refunds are issued once the first draft has been
          delivered, as the core value of the service has been provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>c) Revisions.</strong> You are entitled to revisions in line with the package you purchased
          (for example, a defined number of revision rounds within a specific timeframe).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>d) Escalation.</strong> If you are dissatisfied after reasonable revisions, your case may be
          escalated for a senior review and a final revision round, instead of a refund.
        </p>

        <h3 id="stage-4">2.4 Stage 4 – After final delivery or revision window expiry</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>a) Definition.</strong> Your project has been marked as completed, and/or the revision window
          defined in your package has expired.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>b) Refund eligibility.</strong> No refunds are available at this stage. Any additional changes or
          updates are treated as a new engagement or may be offered as a paid refresh service.
        </p>

        <h2 id="revisions-policy">3. Revisions Policy</h2>

        <h3 id="revisions-in-packages">3.1 Inclusion in packages</h3>
        <p>
          Each service package includes a defined number of revision rounds and a revision timeframe. These details
          are communicated at the time of purchase.
        </p>

        <h3 id="scope-of-revisions">3.2 Scope of revisions</h3>
        <p>
          Revisions are intended to refine and improve the documents based on your feedback, not to completely change
          your role, industry, or seniority target unless agreed as an upgraded service.
        </p>

        <h3 id="client-response-times">3.3 Client response times</h3>
        <p>
          To keep your project moving, you are expected to provide feedback within the agreed timelines. Extended
          delays in responding may result in your project being closed or additional fees to reactivate.
        </p>

        <h2 id="no-guarantees">4. No Guarantees of Employment or Interview</h2>
        <p>
          While our goal is to significantly improve the quality and positioning of your professional documents, we do
          not control employer decisions, market demand, or recruitment processes. We therefore do not guarantee any
          specific outcome, including job offers, interviews, or recruiter responses. Refunds are not granted on the
          basis of job search outcomes.
        </p>

        <h2 id="client-responsibilities">5. Client Responsibilities and Misrepresentation</h2>

        <h3 id="accuracy-of-information">5.1 Accuracy of information</h3>
        <p>
          You are responsible for providing accurate, truthful and complete information about your experience,
          qualifications and achievements.
        </p>

        <h3 id="misrepresentation">5.2 Misrepresentation</h3>
        <p>
          If we discover that you have supplied false or misleading information (for example, fabricated roles,
          inflated titles, or inaccurate dates), we may terminate the engagement with no refund and decline further
          work.
        </p>

        <h3 id="timely-communication">5.3 Timely communication</h3>
        <p>
          You are expected to respond to our questions and requests for clarification within reasonable timeframes so
          that we can deliver your documents on time.
        </p>

        <h2 id="unresponsive-clients">6. Unresponsive Clients and Project Closure</h2>

        <h3 id="inactivity">6.1 Inactivity</h3>
        <p>
          If you become unresponsive for more than thirty (30) calendar days after we request information or feedback,
          we may close your project and mark the service as delivered based on the work completed up to that point.
        </p>

        <h3 id="reactivation">6.2 Reactivation</h3>
        <p>
          Reactivating a closed project may attract an additional fee, which will be communicated to you before any
          further work is carried out.
        </p>

        <h2 id="payment-disputes">7. Payment Disputes and Chargebacks</h2>

        <h3 id="internal-resolution">7.1 Internal resolution first</h3>
        <p>
          If you have concerns about your service, you agree to contact us first so we can attempt to resolve the
          issue through revisions, clarification, or a suitable credit, where appropriate.
        </p>

        <h3 id="chargebacks">7.2 Chargebacks</h3>
        <p>
          Initiating a chargeback or payment dispute with your bank or payment provider without engaging our internal
          process may result in suspension of our services to you. We reserve the right to submit all supporting
          documentation to the payment provider to demonstrate the work delivered.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-to-request-refund">8. How to Request a Refund or Raise a Concern</h2>

        <h3 id="contact-channel">8.1 Contact channel</h3>
        <p>

        <h3 id="review-process">8.3 Review process</h3>
        <p>
          We will review your request in line with this Policy, the stage of your project, and the evidence of work
          completed. We will then communicate our decision and any next steps.
        </p>

        <h2 id="updates-policy">9. Updates to This Policy</h2>

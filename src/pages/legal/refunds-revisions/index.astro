      <LegalSection id="core-principles" heading="1. Core Principles">
        <p>
          Our products are professional services (CVs, cover letters, LinkedIn profiles and related documentation),
          not physical goods. Once work has started, our team invests time, expertise and judgment into your
          documents and consultation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We aim to be fair to clients while protecting the time and expertise of our team. Refund and revision
          decisions are based on the stage of work reached, the scope agreed, and evidence of what has been delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          We cannot and do not guarantee a job, interview, promotion or recruiter response. Outcomes depend on
          broader market conditions, employer decisions and your overall profile and performance.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection
        id="stages-and-eligibility"
        heading="2. Stages of service and refund eligibility"
      >
        <p>
          Our policy is based on clear project stages. Eligibility for a refund or credit depends on the stage your
          order is in when the request is made.
        </p>

        <h3 id="stage-1">2.1 Stage 1 – Payment received, work not yet started</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>a) Definition.</strong> You have paid for a service, but you have not yet submitted the required
          intake information or documents, and no writer or consultant has been assigned to your project.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>b) Work not started.</strong> “Work has not started” means no time has been spent reviewing your
          CV, intake form or supporting documents.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>c) Refund eligibility.</strong> If you request a refund at this stage, and it is within thirty (30)
          calendar days of payment, we may provide a refund less any non-recoverable transaction or processing fees.
          Alternatively, at our discretion, we may convert the full amount into a time-limited service credit for use
          on our services.
        </p>

        <h3 id="stage-2">2.2 Stage 2 – Intake received, initial assessment underway</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>a) Definition.</strong> You have submitted your intake information and/or CV, and a writer or
          consultant has begun assessing your materials, but the first draft has not yet been delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>b) Work in progress.</strong> At this stage, our team has already invested professional time in
          reviewing your profile and planning the work.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>c) Refund eligibility.</strong> Because substantial work typically occurs at this stage, full
          refunds are not available. Any approved refund will normally be partial, reflecting the work already
          undertaken, and is assessed on a case-by-case basis. In some cases, we may instead offer a time-limited
          service credit.
        </p>

        <h3 id="stage-3">2.3 Stage 3 – After first draft is delivered</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>a) Definition.</strong> You have received the first draft of your CV or related document(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>b) Refund eligibility.</strong> Once a first draft has been delivered, the core service has been
          substantially provided and monetary refunds are generally not available.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>c) Revisions.</strong> Your entitlement at this stage is to use the revision rounds and support
          included in your package (for example, a defined number of revision rounds within a specific timeframe).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>d) Escalation.</strong> If you remain dissatisfied after reasonable revisions, your case may be
          escalated for a senior review and a final revision round, instead of a refund.
        </p>

        <h3 id="stage-4">2.4 Stage 4 – Final delivery or revision window expiry</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>a) Definition.</strong> Your project has been marked as completed and/or the revision window defined
          in your package has expired.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>b) Refund eligibility.</strong> At this stage, no refunds are provided. Any additional changes or
          updates are treated as a new engagement or may be offered as a paid refresh or upgrade service.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="revisions-policy" heading="3. Revisions Policy">
        <h3 id="revisions-in-packages">3.1 Inclusion in packages</h3>
        <p>
          Each service package includes a defined number of revision rounds and a revision timeframe. These details
          are communicated at the time of purchase (for example, “up to 2 revision rounds within 14 days of first
          draft delivery”).
        </p>

        <h3 id="scope-of-revisions">3.2 Scope of revisions</h3>
        <p>
          Revisions are intended to refine and improve the documents based on your feedback. Typical revision
          activities include clarifying responsibilities and achievements, adjusting wording, tone or emphasis,
          reordering sections or bullet points, and minor adjustments to the target role within the same general
          field and seniority level.
        </p>

        <h3 id="changes-in-scope">3.3 Changes in scope</h3>
        <p>
          Revisions are not intended to cover fundamental changes in scope that amount to a new project, such as
          switching to a completely different role or industry, shifting from entry-level to senior executive
          targeting, or requesting multiple alternative versions for totally different roles in a single package.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where requested changes fall outside the agreed scope (for example, a major career pivot or additional
          documents not originally included), we will explain this clearly and may propose an upgrade or a new
          service rather than treating it as a revision.
        </p>

        <h3 id="client-response-times">3.4 Client response times</h3>
        <p>
          To keep your project focused and efficient, you are expected to provide clear, consolidated feedback within
          the agreed revision timeframe. If the revision window passes without feedback, the project may be considered
          complete and closed, and further changes may require a new engagement or reactivation fee.
        </p>
      </LegalSection>

      <LegalSection id="no-guarantees" heading="4. No guarantees of employment or interview">
        <p>
          Our goal is to significantly improve the quality and positioning of your professional documents and to
          present your experience as strongly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we do not control employer decisions, recruitment processes or market conditions. A lack of
          interviews, job offers, promotions or recruiter responses after using our services does not, by itself,
          qualify you for a refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have concerns about the quality or accuracy of your documents, please raise them promptly within
          the revision window so they can be addressed.

        <h3 id="accuracy-of-information">5.1 Accuracy of information</h3>
        <p>
          You are responsible for providing accurate, truthful and complete information about your experience,
          qualifications and achievements. Our work relies on the information you supply.
        </p>

        <h3 id="misrepresentation">5.2 Misrepresentation</h3>
        <p>
          If we discover that information you provided is materially false or misleading (for example, fabricated
          roles, fictitious employers or qualifications, or significantly inaccurate dates), we may refuse to
          continue the project, decline further work and decline to offer refunds.
        </p>

        <h3 id="consequences-of-inaccurate-data">5.3 Consequences of inaccurate data</h3>
        <p>
          We are not responsible for consequences arising from inaccurate or incomplete information you supply, and
          such issues do not entitle you to a refund.

        heading="6. Unresponsive clients and project closure"

        <h3 id="inactivity">6.1 Inactivity</h3>
        <p>
          Our ability to deliver high-quality work depends on timely cooperation. If, after paying for a service, you
          do not provide the required intake information or respond to our communications, your project may stall.
        </p>

        <h3 id="closure-after-inactivity">6.2 Closure after extended inactivity</h3>
        <p>
          If we have not received the necessary intake information, feedback or responses from you within thirty (30)
          calendar days, we may pause or close the project and mark it as inactive or delivered (based on the stage
          reached) and treat the order as non-refundable in line with the relevant stage provisions in Section 2.
        </p>

        <h3 id="reactivation">6.3 Reactivation</h3>
        <p>
          If you return after a prolonged period of inactivity, we may need to treat your request as a new project or
          charge a reactivation or update fee, particularly if your experience has changed or previous drafts are
          outdated.

          issue through clarification, revisions or, where appropriate, a partial refund or credit in line with this
          Policy.
        </p>

        <h3 id="chargebacks">7.2 Chargebacks</h3>
        <p>
          Initiating a chargeback or payment dispute with your bank, card issuer or payment provider without engaging
          our internal process may result in suspension of our services to you. We reserve the right to submit all
          supporting documentation (including drafts delivered, communication history and this Policy) to the payment
          provider to demonstrate the work completed.

        <p>
          We aim to review and respond to refund or revision-related concerns within a reasonable business timeframe.

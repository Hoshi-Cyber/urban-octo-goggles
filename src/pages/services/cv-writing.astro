  <h2>Why a professional CV matters in Kenya</h2>
  <p>
    Your CV is evaluated in seconds. Recruiters and HR systems look for clarity,
    relevance, and evidence of impact. A professionally crafted CV reduces
    friction, positions you intelligently, and improves the likelihood of being
    shortlisted for roles that fit your skills and trajectory.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most self-written CVs undersell potential—either by focusing on tasks rather
    than achievements, mixing formats, or missing the language employers scan
    for. Our role is to translate your experience into a clear, confident,
    outcome-led document aligned to your target roles in the Kenyan market.
  </p>

  <h3>What’s included in our CV writing service</h3>
  <ul class="service-list service-list--included">
    <li>
      A structured intake to understand your goals, target roles, challenges,
      and the professional image you want to project.
    </li>
    <li>
      A fully rewritten CV tailored to your seniority, industry, and the
      expectations of Kenyan recruiters and hiring managers.
    </li>
    <li>
      ATS-friendly formatting and keyword optimisation for local job boards and
      applicant tracking systems.
    </li>
    <li>
      A revision window to refine tone, emphasis, and clarity once you review
      the first draft.
    </li>
    <li>
      Optional alignment with LinkedIn and cover letter packages for a cohesive
      career brand across platforms.
    </li>

## Outcome in 30 seconds
Signal governance readiness and value creation at scale. Lead with strategy, risk, capital allocation, and stakeholder outcomes.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: governance and compliance
Reference board committees, audit, risk, ESG, and reporting cadence aligned to CMA codes and NSE norms.

### Signal 2: capital and transformation
Show portfolio impact: ROIC, EBITDA, market share, expansions, and M&A.

## Steps

### Step 1: executive summary with positioning
Two to four lines. Name sector, scale, and signature results.

### Step 2: board-ready evidence
List committee work, policies approved, and disclosures improved.

### Step 3: outcomes per role
3–5 bullets per role with KES and ratios. Include regional mandates (EA, SSA).

## Outcome in 30 seconds

Recruiters skim for value creation. Measure cost, time, revenue, risk, quality, and scale. Convert duties to numbers and Kenya-specific KPIs.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: outcome families

Revenue, cost, uptime, compliance, customer metrics (NPS/CSAT), coverage, and collection rates. Express results in **KES**, %, and time saved.

### Signal 2: scope and complexity

Show budgets, team size, locations, and systems owned. Nairobi/regional scope matters.

## Steps

### Step 1: inventory measurable wins

Pull reports, dashboards, or emails that evidence results. Quantify baselines and deltas.

### Step 2: rewrite with the A→M→R formula

**Action → Metric → Result**. Example: “Negotiated supplier contracts worth **KES 50M**, reducing cost by **12%** and lead time by **2 weeks**.”

### Step 3: prioritise recency and relevance

Keep 5–7 strongest bullets in the last 5–7 years. Older content moves to a “Selected achievements” block.

## Table: metric ideas by function

| Function | Metrics recruiters value                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Finance  | Collection rate, DSO, variance, audit findings     |
| Ops      | Turnaround time, SLA, waste %, on-time delivery    |
| Sales    | Pipeline, conversion, KES closed, retention        |
| IT       | Uptime, incident MTTR, defect rate, security score |

## Checklist (publish-ready)

- [ ] Each role has 2–4 quantified bullets
- [ ] Metrics mapped to Kenyan sector norms
- [ ] Results lead the bullet, action follows
- [ ] Irrelevant tasks removed

## Proof and pitfalls

Proof: outcome-led rewrites lift interview rates across roles. Pitfalls: vanity metrics, unverifiable claims, and walls of text.

## Top 10 mistakes

1. Listing duties, not outcomes  
2. Using decorative templates that break ATS  
3. Writing in paragraphs instead of bullets  
4. Ignoring keywords from Kenyan adverts  
5. No proof (KES, %, or tools used)  
6. Overstuffed personal info  
7. Non-PDF formats  
8. Generic objectives (“seeking challenging role…”)  
9. Typos or tense mismatch  
10. Too long or visually cluttered

**Checklist:** Make every line prove skill, not just state it.

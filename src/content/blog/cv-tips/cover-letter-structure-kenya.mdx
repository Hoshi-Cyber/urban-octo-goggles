## Overview
Cover letters remain one of the most underused yet high-impact elements of job applications in Kenya. When done right, they position you as relevant, credible, and human.

### Structure
1. **Intro (3 lines):** Reference the role and company, and state your positioning.  
2. **Body (2 paragraphs):** Match your experience to the employer’s top problems.  
3. **Close (1 paragraph):** Add a confident call to action.

### Example close
> I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my results in [industry] can strengthen [company’s] objectives in [specific goal].

**Tip:** Use Kenyan spelling and local context, not AI-generic phrasing.

## Outcome in 30 seconds
Projects prove capability quickly. Structure them as short caselets with clear outcomes.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: outcome-first mini caselets
1–2 lines each. Name goal, method, and result in **KES** or %.

### Signal 2: relevance to target role
Prefer projects that mirror the job’s problems.

## Steps

### Step 1: pick 3–5 projects
Include university, freelance, volunteer, or internal improvement work.

### Step 2: write A→M→R
**Action → Metric → Result**. Add links to artefacts or code where applicable.

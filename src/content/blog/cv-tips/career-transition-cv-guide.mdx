## Overview
Kenya’s job market rewards transferable value. Use this guide to pivot sectors without starting from zero.

### Core approach
- Reframe old achievements using target-industry language.  
- Add a bridging sentence in your summary showing awareness of the new field.  
- Include certifications, side projects, or short contracts showing transition proof.

**Example:**  
> From Finance Analyst → Product Manager: Emphasize analytical rigour, user metrics, and process improvement.

**Tip:** Focus on functional value, not titles.

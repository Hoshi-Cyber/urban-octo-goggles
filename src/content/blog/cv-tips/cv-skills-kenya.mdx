## Outcome in 30 seconds
Targeted skills increase match scores and interview rates. Map core hard and soft skills to the role family.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: role-based clustering
Group skills by function to avoid noise. Prioritise tools used locally.

### Signal 2: proof next to skills
Add one proof artefact or metric for each top skill.

## Steps

### Step 1: pick 8–12 core skills
Balance methods, tools, and domain knowledge.

### Step 2: pair each skill with proof
Portfolio link, metric, certification, or system you used.

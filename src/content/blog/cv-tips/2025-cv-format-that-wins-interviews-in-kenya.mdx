## Outcome in 30 seconds

If your CV is gathering dust, change the format. Kenyan recruiters care about outcomes, not job descriptions. Lead with quantified achievements, mirror the job advert, and keep your document concise. A two-page CV showing how you saved KES or time beats a five-page biography every time.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: outcomes first
Recruiters in Nairobi spend seconds scanning your CV. They want proof that you solved problems similar to theirs. Put the most impressive metric first, then explain the action that led to it. Keep verbs simple.

### Signal 2: tailor for ATS and human readers
Include keywords from the job advert but avoid stuffing. Use a clear structure: Summary, Skills, Experience, Education, Certifications. Use a single-column layout and export as PDF.

## Steps

### Step 1: research the role
Pick a job posting that matches your target. Identify five to seven requirements. Copy the verbs and nouns that repeat and build them into your summary and bullet points.

### Step 2: rewrite your bullet points
Use **action + scope + metric + result**.
- “Negotiated supplier contracts worth **KES 50M**, cutting costs **12%** and lead times **2 weeks**.”
- “Built a budgeting app with **1,000** downloads in three months.”

### Step 3: edit and localise
Trim to **two pages**. Convert USD to **KES** and note the year. Use Kenyan sector terms and date formats.

## Table: example bullets by level

|      Level | Example outcome-focused bullet                                                                                                            |
| ---------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Graduate | Increased social media engagement by **150%** in six months with weekly LinkedIn polls and analysis.                                      |
| Mid-career | Managed a **KES 30M** budget and delivered **8% under** through supplier negotiations.                                                    |
|     Senior | Cut network downtime **35%** across 120 nodes; **KES 45M** saved in maintenance costs.                                                    |

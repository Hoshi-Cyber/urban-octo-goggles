## Outcome in 30 seconds

If your CV is gathering dust, change the format. Kenyan recruiters care about outcomes, not job descriptions. Lead with quantified achievements, mirror the job advert, and keep your document concise. A two-page CV showing how you saved KES or time beats a five-page biography every time. According to the World Bank’s economic update, Kenya’s unemployment rate spiked to **10.4%** during the pandemic [1], so competition is fierce. To stand out you need to prove value fast.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: outcomes first

Recruiters in Nairobi spend seconds scanning your CV. They want proof that you solved problems similar to theirs. List each role with two to four bullet points showing how you saved money, grew revenue, or reduced risk. Use numbers and KES to anchor impact. Kenya’s labour profile notes that the working-age population is about **30 million** and unemployment is **5.6%** [2]. With so many applicants, metrics get you remembered. Avoid generic adjectives like “dynamic” or “hardworking.”

One mistake we see often is candidates burying results in long paragraphs. Break up text into scannable bullet points. Put the most impressive metric first, then explain the action that led to it. If you reduced costs by 20%, start the bullet with that figure. Keep grammar simple: verbs in past tense and avoid passive constructions.

### Signal 2: tailor for ATS and human readers

Many large Kenyan employers use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter candidates. Include keywords from the job advert, but don’t stuff them. Use a clear structure: contact details, summary, skills, experience, education, and extras. Stick to a simple font and avoid tables or graphics that might confuse parsing software. Use regional spellings and KES figures instead of dollars to show localisation. Ignore hobbies unless they directly relate to the role; they rarely influence interviews.

ATS algorithms rank candidates based on how closely the CV matches the role. To pass, mirror the job title exactly and include synonyms. For example, if a job calls for a “Project Coordinator,” avoid using “Programme Facilitator” exclusively; include both terms. Also ensure your file is a PDF to preserve formatting; Word documents can appear differently across systems.

## Steps

### Step 1: research the role

Start with the end in mind. Pick a job posting that matches your target. Identify five to seven requirements. Common demands for 2025 include data analysis, project management, sustainability knowledge, and digital literacy across sectors. Copy the verbs and nouns that repeat and build them into your summary and bullet points.

Go beyond the advert. Check LinkedIn profiles of people currently in similar roles in Kenya. What skills do they highlight? What certifications do they hold? This research reveals hidden expectations.

### Step 2: rewrite your bullet points

Transform duties into achievements. Use the formula: **action + scope + metric + result**.

- _Mid-career procurement officer_: “Negotiated supplier contracts worth **KES 50M**, cutting costs by **12%** and shortening delivery times by **2 weeks**.”
- _Graduate_: “Led a team of four in developing a budgeting app that reached **1,000 downloads** within three months.”

Quantify even soft skills. If you improved customer satisfaction, cite the change in NPS or number of positive testimonials. If you managed a team, state its size and highlight retention or productivity improvements.

### Step 3: edit and localise

Trim the document to **two pages**. Remove older roles if they don’t support your target. Align education with the **Kenya National Qualifications Framework**. Replace “References available upon request” with a professional development section. Proofread for spelling.

Localise salary and impact. If budgets were in USD, convert impact into KES and note the year. The Labour Market Profile reports **informal employment = 81% of non-agricultural jobs** [2]. Show where you professionalised processes or digitised records.

## Table: example bullets by level

|      Level | Example outcome-focused bullet                                                                                                            |
| ---------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Graduate | Increased social media engagement for a student society by **150%** in six months by running weekly LinkedIn polls and analysing results  |
| Mid-career | Managed a **KES 30M** budget for a Nairobi construction project, delivering on time and **8% under budget** through supplier negotiations |
|     Senior | Led a team of **20 engineers** at a telecommunications firm to cut network downtime by **35%** and save **KES 45M** in maintenance costs  |

## Checklist (publish-ready)

## Proof and pitfalls

In 2024 we overhauled CVs for a Nairobi fintech accelerator. After restructuring around outcomes, **3/5** clients received interview invites within two weeks. One graduate secured a role by highlighting a university project that improved data collection efficiency by **30%**. Another mid-career professional landed a logistics role after reducing transportation costs by **KES 5M** through route optimisation.

**Pitfalls**: copying foreign templates that emphasise personal statements or hobbies, using US salary figures instead of KES, listing every duty, or fabricating numbers.

## Outcome in 30 seconds
Your CV must satisfy two audiences: ATS parsers and busy recruiters. Use explicit section labels, simple layout, and advert-matching tokens.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: section labels ATS expects
Use: **Summary**, **Skills**, **Experience**, **Education**, **Certifications**. Avoid creative headings that hurt parsing.

### Signal 2: tokens that mirror the advert
Mirror exact job-title phrasing and 6–10 repeated nouns and verbs from the advert. Add obvious Kenyan synonyms (project vs programme).

## Steps

### Step 1: pick a target advert
Extract 6–10 requirements and build a token list. Keep regional spellings and **KES** figures.

### Step 2: structure and file rules
One or two pages. Single column. PDF. No tables or images with text.

### Step 3: tokenise bullets
**Action + scope + metric + result** with 1–2 tokens per bullet.
“Automated monthly **M-Pesa** reconciliations for **KES 12M** float, cutting close time **35%**.”

## Table: ATS-safe labels and risky variants

| ATS-safe label | Risky variant    |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Summary        | About me         |
| Experience     | What I did       |
| Education      | Learning journey |
| Skills         | Tools I love     |
| Certifications | Badges           |

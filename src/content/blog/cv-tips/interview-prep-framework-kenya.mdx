## Overview
Most Kenyan employers now use structured behavioral interviews. Prepare answers using STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

### Common question themes
1. Leadership and influence  
2. Problem solving  
3. Adaptability  
4. Integrity and compliance  
5. Team collaboration

**Example:** “Describe a time you improved a process.”  
> Situation: long approval delays; Action: built tracking sheet; Result: turnaround cut 40%.

**Tip:** Align each answer with KES or % results.

## Outcome in 30 seconds

Targeted skills increase match scores and interview rates. Map core hard and soft skills to the role family.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: role-based clustering

Group skills by function to avoid noise. Prioritise tools used locally.

### Signal 2: proof next to skills

Add one proof artefact or metric for each top skill.

## Steps

### Step 1: pick 8–12 core skills

Balance methods, tools, and domain knowledge.

### Step 2: pair each skill with proof

Portfolio link, metric, certification, or system you used.

## Table: example matrix

| Role family | Hard skills                            | Soft skills                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Finance     | IFRS, reconciliations, Excel, Power BI | Stakeholder comms, accuracy, prioritisation    |
| Ops         | SOP design, Lean, inventory, logistics | Coordination, problem solving, time management |
| Sales       | CRM, discovery, proposals, negotiation | Listening, persistence, objection handling     |
| IT          | Networks, SQL, scripting, cloud basics | Incident comms, documentation, teamwork        |

## Checklist (publish-ready)

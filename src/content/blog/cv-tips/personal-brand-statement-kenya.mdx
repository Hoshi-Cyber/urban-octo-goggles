## Overview
Your personal brand statement is your positioning line — the first impression. Kenyan recruiters scan it before deciding whether to continue reading.

### Formula
**Role + Scope + Proof + Value.**

Example:
> Finance Manager | 10 years in FMCG | Cut costs 12% | CPA-K & SAP Certified.

**Tips**
- Use job titles as in Kenyan listings.  
- Avoid vague adjectives (“hardworking,” “dynamic”).  
- Always show one metric of impact.

## Outcome in 30 seconds

Your CV must satisfy two audiences: ATS parsers and busy recruiters. Use explicit section labels, simple layout, and role-matching tokens to raise match scores without keyword stuffing.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: section labels ATS expects

Use: **Summary**, **Skills**, **Experience**, **Education**, **Certifications**. Avoid creative headings like “What I Do” that reduce parse accuracy. Prefer plain lists over tables or columns.

### Signal 2: tokens that mirror the advert

Mirror exact job-title phrasing and 6–10 repeated nouns and verbs from the advert. Add obvious synonyms recruiters use in Kenya (project vs programme; ledger vs accounts).

## Steps

### Step 1: pick a target advert

Extract 6–10 requirements. Build a token list: job title, core tools, methods, sector terms. Keep regional spellings and **KES** figures.

### Step 2: structure and file rules

- One or two pages.
- Font: system sans or serif.
- File: **PDF**.
- No text in images. No tables. Left-aligned text, single column.

### Step 3: tokenise bullets

Use **action + scope + metric + result** and inject 1–2 tokens per bullet. Example: “Automated monthly **M-Pesa** reconciliations for **KES 12M** float, cutting closure time by **35%**.”

## Table: ATS-safe labels and risky variants

| ATS-safe label | Risky variant    |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Summary        | About me         |
| Experience     | What I did       |
| Education      | Learning journey |
| Skills         | Tools I love     |
| Certifications | Badges           |

## Checklist (publish-ready)

- [ ] Exact job title appears in Summary and Experience
- [ ] 10–15 tokens appear naturally, not stuffed
- [ ] Bullet formula used with **KES** or % metrics
- [ ] Simple PDF, single column, no tables
- [ ] No graphics that hold text

## Proof and pitfalls

Proof: candidates who adopted explicit labels and tokenised bullets saw higher ATS match rates and callbacks. Pitfalls: graphics-based templates, columns, and jargon headings.

## Context

Recruiters in Kenya regularly handle **200–500+ applications per role**, especially in NGO programmes, finance, administration, customer service, and early-career positions. Because of this volume, they must make fast, structured decisions.

Contrary to what many jobseekers believe, recruiters are not being unfair or careless. They are applying a **necessary operational filter** to identify candidates worth deeper review.

The first scan of a CV lasts **6–10 seconds** and is used to answer three questions:

1. **Is this person relevant to the role?**
2. **Do their recent roles align with the job?**
3. **Is their experience at the correct level (junior/mid/senior)?**

If the answer to any of these questions appears to be “no,” the CV is moved to the rejection pile—long before achievements or certifications are read.

This guide shows you the exact screening process used by Kenyan recruiters and how to position your CV for instant shortlist eligibility.

## Framework

Across industries, most Kenyan recruiters follow a consistent mental model for shortlisting CVs.

### The 3-Layer Recruiter Shortlisting Framework (Kenya-Specific)

**Layer 1 — Positioning**  
Does this CV communicate the correct role identity?

**Layer 2 — Relevance**  
Does the recent experience match the job description?

**Layer 3 — Competence**  
Does the candidate show measurable outcomes or growth?

If your CV passes these three layers, you enter the **shortlist pile**. If not, it is filtered out—regardless of your potential.

### How ATS Systems Filter Candidates Before Recruiters See Them

Most Kenyan organisations now use ATS platforms such as:

- BrighterMonday employer tools  
- BambooHR  
- Oracle/Taleo-style systems  
- In-house HRIS with keyword filtering  

These systems check your CV for:

- Matching skills and keywords  
- Role title relevance  
- Seniority level  
- Keyword density  
- Formatting compatibility  

**ATS struggles with:**

- Tables  
- Icons  
- Multi-column layouts  
- Embedded graphics  
- Uncommon fonts  

A clean, text-based CV almost always ranks higher and is more likely to reach a human recruiter who then applies the 3-layer framework.

## Steps

### 1. The First 2 Seconds: The Headline & Summary Scan

The very top of your CV determines whether the recruiter continues reading.

They scan for:

- Your **professional headline**
- Your **recent role title**
- Your **industry alignment**
- Your **core professional identity**

**Strong examples:**

- “Finance Officer | Reporting • Reconciliations • Budget Management”
- “Administrative Assistant | Office Support • Documentation • Scheduling”
- “Customer Experience Associate | Issue Resolution • Client Relations”

These give the recruiter confidence that you belong in the shortlist category.

**Weak examples:**

- “Professional”
- “Open to Work”
- “Job Seeker”
- “Operations Officer” (without context)

A recruiter must immediately understand **who you are** and **what type of work you can perform**.

---

### 2. Seconds 3–6: Relevance & Recency Evaluation

Recruiters next check:

- Your **latest job title**
- The **organisation** you worked for
- Your **tenure**
- The **first 1–2 bullet points**

They are looking for:

- Evidence of competence  
- Alignment with the job description (JD)  
- Stability (not job-hopping every few months)  
- Signs of progressive responsibility  

**A strong first bullet looks like:**

- “Improved monthly reconciliation accuracy by 22% by restructuring the reporting workflow.”

**A weak first bullet looks like:**

- “Responsible for preparing reports.”

Hiring managers want **results**, not activity lists.

---

### 3. Seconds 6–10: The ATS & Keyword Confirmation Scan

Once the recruiter sees you are relevant, they quickly check for:

- A **skills section** containing core competencies listed in the JD  
- Keywords that match the industry (e.g., “donor compliance,” “variance analysis,” “customer resolution,” etc.)  
- Alignment between your summary, skills, and experience  
- Clean formatting that signals professionalism  

This is where candidates lose out simply because their CV does not speak the JD’s language.

**Example:**  
A JD asks for:

- “Procurement planning”
- “Vendor management”
- “Inventory tracking”

The CV should reflect **the same terminology**, not vague synonyms like “supply coordination”. ATS and busy recruiters are literal.

---

### 4. How to Structure Your CV for the 10-Second Test

Use this sequence consistently:

**1. Professional Headline**  
Aligned with your target JD.

**2. Professional Summary (3–4 lines)**  
Clear, outcomes-focused, relevant to the role.

**3. Key Skills Section**  
8–12 ATS-ready terms.

**4. Work Experience**  
Role → Organisation → Dates → Achievements.

**5. Education & Certifications**  
Sorted by importance.

**6. Optional (if relevant)**  
Projects, Awards, Volunteer Work.

This structure improves scanability and reduces recruiter friction.

---

### 5. How to Tailor Your CV for Each JD (Kenya’s Biggest Shortlisting Lever)

Most candidates never tailor their CVs—this is why they get no callbacks.

**Effective tailoring requires:**

- Picking the right headline  
- Adjusting your summary to match the JD  
- Reordering bullet points to prioritise relevant outcomes  
- Updating your skills section  
- Adding relevant keywords the JD actually uses  

**Never tailor by:**

- Copy-pasting the JD into your CV (instant rejection)

Tailoring is about **alignment**, not mimicry.

### 6. Checklist: Make Your CV Shortlist-Ready in 10 Seconds

Use this quick self-review before every application:

1. Write a precise professional headline aligned with the role.  
2. Create a concise summary that communicates relevance and strengths.  
3. Lead with measurable achievements in each role.  
4. Build a skills section that matches JD terminology.  
5. Use clean, ATS-friendly formatting (one column, no tables/icons).  
6. Remove irrelevant certifications and distracting information.  
7. Tailor bullet order and skills to the specific vacancy.  
8. Align your LinkedIn headline with your CV positioning.

## Mistakes

### What Makes Recruiters Reject CVs Instantly (Common Patterns)

1. **Misaligned headlines**  
   “Admin Officer” applying to roles for “Procurement Assistant.”

2. **Wrong industry vocabulary**  
   Using “customer relations” for a call centre role instead of “issue resolution.”

3. **Duty-focused experience**  
   Recruiters want **achievements**, not job descriptions.

4. **No skills section**  
   ATS systems de-prioritize CVs without matching competencies.

5. **Dense formatting**  
   Paragraph-only CVs get skipped immediately.

6. **Random job hopping**  
   Short tenures are acceptable when explained—but not when repetitive.

7. **Irrelevant certifications**  
   Listing unrelated courses confuses your professional identity.

### The Recruiter’s Final Filter: Perceived Professionalism

Recruiters also evaluate:

- Grammar  
- Layout consistency  
- Tone  
- Clarity  
- Seniority alignment  

A CV that is neat, structured, and relevant signals professionalism.  
A messy CV signals risk.

## Examples

### High-Scoring vs Low-Scoring CV Snippets

**HIGH-SCORING**  
**Bullet (Finance Officer):**  
“Reduced month-end closing time by 25% by tightening reconciliations and automating variance reports.”

**Why this wins:**  

- Clear result  
- ATS keywords: “month-end closing”, “reconciliations”, “variance”  
- Demonstrates competence  

---

**LOW-SCORING**  
**Bullet:**  
“Responsible for preparing reports.”

**Why this loses:**  

- No outcomes  
- No keywords  
- No evidence of competence  

High-scoring snippets are **specific, measurable, and JD-aligned**.  
Low-scoring snippets are vague and generic.

---

## Implementation Checklist

Use this as a practical, recruiter-aligned implementation list for the 10-second test:

- Rewrite your CV headline to match your target role family and core function.  
- Adjust your summary to speak directly to the JD (role, sector, and level).  
- Ensure your latest role and first bullet clearly show relevance and impact.  
- Create a dedicated **Key Skills** section with 8–12 JD-aligned competencies.  
- Remove dense paragraphs and convert experience into short, measurable bullets.  
- Simplify your layout to a clean, one-column, ATS-friendly structure.  
- Remove or minimise irrelevant certifications and roles that confuse your narrative.  
- Tailor your CV and LinkedIn headline before each application to reflect the vacancy language.

## DIY vs Expert

You can usually **DIY** your CV when:

- You have a straightforward career path  
- You’re early-career with 0–3 years of experience  
- You’re confident writing achievement-focused bullets  
- You understand how to map your work to JD language  

You should consider **expert support** when:

- You’re not getting shortlisted despite relevant experience  
- You’re changing industries or moving into more senior roles  
- Your work history is complex (contract roles, breaks, multiple transitions)  
- You’re targeting highly competitive NGO, corporate, or multinational roles  
- You struggle to quantify your achievements or structure your story  

A professional rewrite helps you:

- Align tightly with recruiter and ATS filters  
- Present a clear, seniority-aligned narrative  
- Translate your responsibilities into measurable impact  
- Increase your shortlist rate for roles that actually fit your profile

## Why Shortlisting Happens in 10 Seconds

Recruiters in Kenya regularly handle **200–500+ applications per role**, especially in NGO programmes, finance, administration, customer service, and early-career positions. Because of this volume, they must make fast, structured decisions.

Contrary to what many jobseekers believe, recruiters are not being unfair or careless. They are applying a **necessary operational filter** to identify candidates worth deeper review.

The first scan of a CV lasts **6–10 seconds** and is used to answer three questions:

1. **Is this person relevant to the role?**  
2. **Do their recent roles align with the job?**  
3. **Is their experience at the correct level (junior/mid/senior)?**

If the answer to any of these questions appears to be “no,” the CV is moved to the rejection pile—long before achievements or certifications are read.

This guide shows you the exact screening process used by Kenyan recruiters and how to position your CV for instant shortlist eligibility.

## 1. The First 2 Seconds: The Headline & Summary Scan

The very top of your CV determines whether the recruiter continues reading.

They scan for:

- Your **professional headline**  
- Your **recent role title**  
- Your **industry alignment**  
- Your **core professional identity**  

### Strong examples:
- “Finance Officer | Reporting • Reconciliations • Budget Management”  
- “Administrative Assistant | Office Support • Documentation • Scheduling”  
- “Customer Experience Associate | Issue Resolution • Client Relations”  

These give the recruiter confidence that you belong in the shortlist category.

### Weak examples:
- “Professional”  
- “Open to Work”  
- “Job Seeker”  
- “Operations Officer” (without context)

A recruiter must immediately understand **who you are** and **what type of work you can perform**.

---

## 2. Seconds 3–6: Relevance & Recency Evaluation

Recruiters next check:

- Your **latest job title**  
- The **organisation** you worked for  
- Your **tenure**  
- The **first 1–2 bullet points**  

They are looking for:

- Evidence of competence  
- Alignment with the job description (JD)  
- Stability (not job-hopping every few months)  
- Signs of progressive responsibility  

### A strong first bullet looks like:
- “Improved monthly reconciliation accuracy by 22% by restructuring the reporting workflow.”

### A weak first bullet looks like:
- “Responsible for preparing reports.”

Hiring managers want **results**, not activity lists.

---

## 3. Seconds 6–10: The ATS & Keyword Confirmation Scan

Once the recruiter sees you are relevant, they quickly check for:

- A **skills section** containing core competencies listed in the JD  
- Keywords that match the industry (e.g., “donor compliance,” “variance analysis,” “customer resolution,” etc.)  
- Alignment between your summary, skills, and experience  
- Clean formatting that signals professionalism  

This is where candidates lose out simply because their CV does not speak the JD’s language.

### Example:
A JD asks for:
- “Procurement planning”
- “Vendor management”
- “Inventory tracking”

The CV should reflect **the same terminology**, not synonyms like “supply coordination.”

ATS is literal.

## 4. How ATS Systems Filter Candidates Before Recruiters See Them

Most Kenyan organisations now use ATS platforms:

- **BrighterMonday Employer Tools**  
- **BambooHR**  
- **Oracle/Taleo-style systems**  
- **In-house HRIS with keyword filtering**  

These systems check your CV for:

- Matching skills  
- Role title relevance  
- Seniority level  
- Keyword density  
- Formatting compatibility  

### ATS struggles with:
- Tables  
- Icons  
- Multi-column layouts  
- Embedded graphics  
- Uncommon fonts  

A clean, text-based CV almost always ranks higher.

## The 3-Layer Recruiter Shortlisting Framework (Kenya-Specific)

Across industries, most Kenyan recruiters follow the same mental model.

### **Layer 1 — Positioning**
Does this CV communicate the correct role identity?

### **Layer 2 — Relevance**
Does the recent experience match the job description?

### **Layer 3 — Competence**
Does the candidate show measurable outcomes or growth?

If your CV passes these three layers, you **enter the shortlist pile**.

If not, it is filtered out—regardless of your potential.

## 5. What Makes Recruiters Reject CVs Instantly (Common Patterns)

### 1. Misaligned headlines  
“Admin Officer” applying to roles for “Procurement Assistant.”

### 2. Wrong industry vocabulary  
E.g., Using “customer relations” for a call centre role instead of “issue resolution.”

### 3. Duty-focused experience  
Recruiters want **achievements**, not job descriptions.

### 4. No skills section  
ATS systems de-prioritize CVs without matching competencies.

### 5. Dense formatting  
Paragraph-only CVs get skipped immediately.

### 6. Random job hopping  
Short tenures are acceptable when explained—but not when repetitive.

### 7. Irrelevant certifications  
Listing unrelated courses confuses your professional identity.

## 6. How to Structure Your CV for the 10-Second Test

Use this sequence consistently:

### **1. Professional Headline**  
Aligned with your target JD.

### **2. Professional Summary (3–4 lines)**  
Clear, outcomes-focused, relevant to the role.

### **3. Key Skills Section**  
8–12 ATS-ready terms.

### **4. Work Experience**  
Role → Organisation → Dates → Achievements

### **5. Education & Certifications**  
Sorted by importance.

### **6. Optional (if relevant)**  
Projects, Awards, Volunteer Work.

This structure improves scanability and reduces recruiter friction.

---

## 7. How to Tailor Your CV for Each JD (Kenya’s Biggest Shortlisting Lever)

Most candidates never tailor their CVs—this is why they get no callbacks.

### Tailoring requires:
- Picking the right headline  
- Adjusting your summary to match the JD  
- Reordering bullet points  
- Updating your skills section  
- Adding relevant keywords  

### Never tailor by:
- Copy-pasting the JD into your CV (instant rejection)  

Tailoring is about **alignment**, not mimicry.

## 8. Examples of High-Scoring vs Low-Scoring CV Snippets

### HIGH-SCORING
**Bullet (Finance Officer):**  
“Reduced month-end closing time by 25% by tightening reconciliations and automating variance reports.”

**Why this wins:**  
- Clear result  
- ATS keywords: "month-end closing", "reconciliations", "variance"  
- Demonstrates competence  

### LOW-SCORING
**Bullet:**  
“Responsible for preparing reports.”  
**Why this loses:**  
- No outcomes  
- No keywords  
- No evidence of competence

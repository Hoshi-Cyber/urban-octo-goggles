## The 2025 Reality of CV Screening in Kenya

The hiring landscape in Kenya has changed. Recruiters in NGOs, corporates, SMEs, and government institutions process increasingly large pools of applicants—often more than **400 CVs per job posting**. The result is a shortlisting environment where:

- The **first scan lasts 6–10 seconds**  
- **ATS systems filter applicants** before human review  
- **Clarity and relevance** outweigh years of experience  
- **Format and structure** influence perceived professionalism  

A modern Kenyan CV must function as both a **human-readable narrative** and a **machine-readable data source**.  
This guide gives you the complete 2025 format engineered for both.

The goal is simple:  
**Help the recruiter immediately see that you are the right fit.**

---

## 1. Start With a Targeted Professional Header

Your header is not just contact information—it establishes your identity and relevance.

A strong header includes:

- Full name  
- Professional headline that matches your target roles  
- Phone number  
- Email  
- LinkedIn profile URL  

### What the recruiter is evaluating here:
- Do you fit the role at first glance?  
- Is your level/seniority clear?  
- Do you understand the industry language?  

### Example of a strong role-aligned header:
> **“Finance Officer | Financial Reporting | Budgeting & Compliance”**

### Weak header examples:
- “Professional”  
- “Job Seeker”  
- “Unemployed”  
- Overly generic terms (“Administrator”, “Officer”) without context  

Your headline must communicate **precision**, not ambiguity.

---

## 2. Write a Concise, Impact-Led Professional Summary

The summary is not a biography—it is a **positioning statement**.

A strong summary answers four questions quickly:

1. Who are you (professionally)?  
2. What is your experience level?  
3. What are your core strengths?  
4. Why would you fit the role you are applying for?  

### Example (Kenya-specific):
> “Results-driven HR professional with 6+ years of experience supporting recruitment, onboarding, employee relations, and HRIS administration across NGO and private-sector environments. Recognised for improving hiring turnaround time and strengthening employee support systems.”

### Avoid:
- Soft skills (“hardworking”, “team player”)  
- Generalities (“I am passionate…”)  
- Long paragraphs (2–3 lines max)  

Your summary must anchor your entire CV.

---

## 3. Structure Your Work Experience for Immediate Clarity

The work experience section carries the most weight in shortlisting.

Use this sequence consistently:

**Role Title → Organisation → Location → Dates → Bullets (Achievements)**

### Recruiters scan for:
- Recent experience  
- Stability and progression  
- Industry relevance  
- Impact and results  

### Strong formatting example:
**Finance Assistant  
ABC Foundation, Nairobi  
Jan 2021 – Present**

- Improved monthly reconciliation accuracy by 22% by restructuring reporting templates and validation steps.  
- Supported budgeting for 10+ active programmes, producing variance analyses used in quarterly donor updates.  
- Strengthened internal controls by introducing a two-level documentation standard.

### Common mistakes:
- Mixing duties with achievements (keep duties minimal)  
- Writing dense paragraphs instead of bullets  
- Listing irrelevant tasks  

---

## 4. Use Achievement-Based Bullets, Not Duty Lists

### Weak (duty-based):
- “Responsible for preparing financial reports.”  
- “Handled customer inquiries.”  
- “Assisted with procurement tasks.”  

### Strong (achievement-based):
- “Improved financial reporting accuracy by 25% by standardising reconciliation workflows.”  
- “Resolved 85% of customer issues on first contact, increasing satisfaction scores.”  
- “Reduced procurement cycle time by 18% by optimising vendor management processes.”

Achievements show **value**, not activity.

---

## 5. Tailor Your CV to the Job Description (JD)

Kenyan recruiters consistently shortlist candidates who demonstrate **role alignment**.

### Tailoring checklist:
- Mirror JD terminology  
- Emphasise domain-specific skills  
- Reorder bullets to prioritise relevant strengths  
- Remove unrelated experience  

### Example:
If a JD emphasises:
- “Budget monitoring”
- “Donor reporting”
- “Internal controls”

Your CV should reflect:
- Achievements in donor environments  
- Experience with budgeting cycles  
- Evidence of strengthening controls  

Generic CVs rarely get shortlisted.

---

## 6. Include a Skills Section Optimised for ATS

ATS systems rely heavily on keywords in your skills section.

### Example format:
**Key Skills:**
- Financial reporting  
- Reconciliations  
- ERP systems (SAP, QuickBooks)  
- Budgeting & forecasting  
- Variance analysis  
- Internal controls  

### Avoid:
- Overly broad terms (“communication”, “leadership”)  
- Skills not aligned to your target roles  

Keep it role-specific and industry-consistent.

---

## 7. Order Your Education and Certifications Strategically

### If you have < 3 years of experience:
Place **Education** above **Experience**.

### If you have > 3 years of experience:
Place **Experience** first; education becomes supporting evidence.

### Certifications matter in Kenya:
- CPA  
- ACCA  
- CHRP  
- Diplomas in project management  
- Data analysis certifications  

Include dates where possible.

---

## 8. Add Optional Sections for Additional Strength

These are helpful when relevant:

- **Projects** (demonstration of competence)  
- **Awards** (validated excellence)  
- **Volunteer experience** (especially in NGO sector)  
- **Languages** (for multinational organisations)  

These sections should support—not distract from—your main narrative.

---

## 9. Avoid Formatting That Breaks ATS Systems

Kenyan ATS systems often struggle with:

- Tables  
- Text boxes  
- Multi-column designs  
- Unusual fonts  
- Images or graphics  
- Icons  

Use a clean, one-column structure with standard headings.

---

## 10. Keep Your CV 1–2 Pages (Kenya Standard)

### 1 page:
- Early-career candidates (0–3 years)

### 2 pages:
- Mid-career and senior candidates (4+ years)

Avoid unnecessary padding or excessive detail.

---

## 11. Final Pre-Submission Checks (Professional Polish)

Before submitting your CV, confirm:

- Are there unnecessary repetitions?  
- Are bullet points specific and measurable?  
- Does the summary reflect your strongest professional angle?  
- Does your LinkedIn match your CV?  
- Is your formatting consistent across sections?  

A polished CV communicates competence before you say a word.

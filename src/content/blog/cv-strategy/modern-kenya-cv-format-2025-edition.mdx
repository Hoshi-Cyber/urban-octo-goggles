## Context

The hiring landscape in Kenya has changed. Recruiters in NGOs, corporates, SMEs, and government institutions process increasingly large pools of applicants—often more than **400 CVs per job posting**. The result is a shortlisting environment where:

- The **first scan lasts 6–10 seconds**
- **ATS systems filter applicants** before human review
- **Clarity and relevance** outweigh years of experience
- **Format and structure** influence perceived professionalism

A modern Kenyan CV must function as both a **human-readable narrative** and a **machine-readable data source**.  
This guide provides the complete 2025 format engineered for both.

The goal is simple:  
**Help the recruiter immediately see that you are the right fit.**

---

## Framework

A modern Kenya CV (2025 edition) must achieve three outcomes simultaneously:

1. **Instant clarity** during the 6–10 second recruiter scan  
2. **Relevance match** against the job description  
3. **ATS compatibility** for machine parsing and keyword recognition  

The overarching CV framework is built around:

- A targeted professional header  
- A concise, positioning-focused summary  
- Clear achievement-driven experience  
- ATS-aligned skills  
- Clean one-column formatting  
- Supporting sections (education, certifications, projects)

This framework ensures your CV works for **both humans and ATS systems**.

---

## Steps

### 1. Start With a Targeted Professional Header

Your header is not just contact information—it establishes your identity and relevance.

A strong header includes:

- Full name
- Professional headline that matches your target roles
- Phone number
- Email
- LinkedIn profile URL

**What recruiters evaluate:**

- Role fit at a glance  
- Seniority clarity  
- Whether you understand industry terminology  

**Strong example:**  
**“Finance Officer | Financial Reporting | Budgeting & Compliance”**

**Weak examples:**

- “Professional”
- “Job Seeker”
- “Administrator” (too generic)

Your headline must communicate **precision**, not ambiguity.

---

### 2. Write a Concise, Impact-Led Professional Summary

The summary is not a biography—it is a **positioning statement**.

It answers four questions:

1. Who are you (professionally)?  
2. What is your experience level?  
3. What are your core strengths?  
4. Why would you fit the role?  

**Example (Kenya-specific):**

> “Results-driven HR professional with 6+ years of experience supporting recruitment, onboarding, employee relations, and HRIS administration across NGO and private-sector environments…”

**Avoid:**

- Soft skills  
- Generic statements  
- Long paragraphs  

---

### 3. Structure Your Work Experience for Immediate Clarity

Use this consistent sequence:

**Role Title → Organisation → Location → Dates → Bullets (Achievements)**

Recruiters scan for:

- Recency  
- Stability  
- Relevance  
- Results  

**Strong formatting example:**

**Finance Assistant  
ABC Foundation, Nairobi  
Jan 2021 – Present**

- Improved reconciliation accuracy by 22%  
- Supported budgeting for 10+ programmes  
- Strengthened internal controls  

---

### 4. Use Achievement-Based Bullets, Not Duty Lists

**Weak:**  
- “Responsible for preparing financial reports.”

**Strong:**  
- “Improved financial reporting accuracy by 25% by standardising reconciliation workflows.”

---

### 5. Tailor Your CV to the Job Description (JD)

Shortlisting strongly rewards **alignment**.

**If JD emphasises:**

- Budget monitoring  
- Donor reporting  
- Internal controls  

**Your CV should emphasise:**  
- Achievements in donor environments  
- Budgeting cycle contributions  
- Strengthening controls  

---

### 6. Include a Skills Section Optimised for ATS

ATS screens heavily for **keyword alignment**.

**Example format:**  
- Financial reporting  
- Reconciliations  
- ERP systems (SAP, QuickBooks)  
- Budgeting & forecasting  

Avoid overly broad terms like "communication" or "leadership".

---

### 7. Order Your Education and Certifications Strategically

**Early-career (< 3 years):** education first  
**Mid-career (> 3 years):** experience first  

Top certifications in Kenya:

- CPA  
- ACCA  
- CHRP  
- Project management  
- Data analysis  

---

### 8. Add Optional Sections for Additional Strength

Use selectively:

- Projects  
- Awards  
- Volunteer experience  
- Languages  

These must reinforce your narrative—not distract.

---

### 9. Avoid Formatting That Breaks ATS Systems

Avoid:

- Tables  
- Multi-column layouts  
- Icons  
- Unusual fonts  
- Text boxes  

Use a clean **one-column**, ATS-safe format.

---

### 10. Keep Your CV to 1–2 Pages (Kenya Standard)

**1 page:** early career  
**2 pages:** mid-career and senior  

Avoid padding and unnecessary detail.

---

### 11. Final Pre-Submission Checks

Before submitting:

- Remove repetitions  
- Ensure bullets are specific  
- Align LinkedIn with your CV  
- Check consistency in formatting  

A polished CV communicates competence instantly.

---

## Mistakes

Common mistakes Kenyan jobseekers make with CVs include:

- Mixing duties with achievements  
- Writing dense paragraphs instead of bullets  
- Listing irrelevant experience  
- Overusing generic soft skills  
- Ignoring JD terminology  
- Using visually complex templates that break ATS parsing  

These mistakes block shortlisting even for strong candidates.

---

## Examples

Below are simplified examples representing **good structure** and **bad structure** in the Kenya 2025 CV context.

### Strong Example

**Finance Officer — Nairobi**  
- Reduced reporting turnaround time by 30%  
- Improved donor audit readiness  
- Strengthened reconciliation accuracy  
- Delivered budgeting inputs for multi-million-shilling programmes  

### Weak Example

**Finance Officer**  
- Responsible for reports  
- Worked with budgets  
- Helped with procurement  
- Attended meetings  

Strong examples show measurable value; weak ones describe activity, not impact.

## DIY vs Expert

A jobseeker can usually **DIY** their CV if:

- They have < 5 years of experience  
- Their career path is straightforward  
- They can write clearly and quantify achievements  

A jobseeker should consider **professional support** when:

- They are changing careers  
- They have 7+ years of experience and need strategic framing  
- They are applying to competitive NGO/corporate roles  
- Their CV has been rejected frequently  
- They struggle to articulate achievements  

Expert rewriting ensures:

- Strategic positioning  
- ATS alignment  
- Strong impact metrics  
- Recruiter clarity

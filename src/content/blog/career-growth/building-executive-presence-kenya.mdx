## Example (Kenyan context)
> A Nairobi-based analyst increased promotion chances by **30%**...active performance review documentation and skill certification.

## Checklist
- [ ] Localised examples and terminology  
- [ ] Outcome-first bullet structure  
- [ ] Metrics and proof points  
- [ ] Simple, clean writing and PDF-ready presentation

**Tip:** Every career action should have measurable outcomes in **KES** or time saved.

## 1. What is executive presence in the Kenyan context?

Executive presence is how senior decision-makers **feel** when you enter a room, contribute to a meeting, or handle pressure.

In Kenya, it’s a mix of:

- Calm, structured communication (especially in tense or unclear situations).
- Respectful confidence with seniors, clients, and regulators.
- Reliability: when you say you’ll deliver, you deliver — consistently.
- Professional polish: how you write emails, show up in meetings, and package your work.

It is not about being loud, extroverted, or having a certain accent. It is about being **trusted with bigger responsibilities**.

## 2. The 3 pillars of executive presence

1. **Gravitas (how seriously people take you)**  
   - You speak with clarity and structure.  
   - You handle difficult questions without panic or defensiveness.  
   - You focus on solutions instead of excuses.

2. **Communication (how well you express ideas)**  
   - Clear, concise emails and reports.  
   - Speaking in simple, logical steps instead of jargon.  
   - Knowing when to listen and when to speak.

3. **Appearance & reliability (how you present and deliver)**  
   - Clean, appropriate dressing for your office culture.  
   - Preparedness: you read the documents, know your numbers, and have a point of view.  
   - Consistent follow-through.

## 3. How Kenyan professionals lose executive presence (silently)

Common mistakes:

- Over-apologising or under-apologising.  
- Speaking in long, unstructured paragraphs in meetings.  
- Avoiding eye contact or always deferring to others, even when you know the answer.  
- Poor email etiquette: emotional tone, unclear subject lines, no structure.  
- Reacting emotionally to feedback from managers or clients.

The result: you’re seen as “hardworking and supportive”, but not as leadership material.

## 4. Communication frameworks that instantly lift presence

Use simple structures:

1. **Situation → Insight → Recommendation (SIR)**  
   - “Here’s what’s happening.”  
   - “Here’s what it means.”  
   - “Here’s what I recommend.”

2. **Problem → Options → Recommendation → Risk**  
   - Especially useful when speaking to senior management.

3. **3-point rule for meetings**  
   - Go in knowing the **three main points** you want to contribute.  
   - If you’re asked a question you’re not ready for:  
     > “I don’t have the exact number now, but I’ll confirm and revert by 3pm.”

This keeps you composed even when unprepared.

## 5. Presence in virtual and hybrid meetings (very common now)

- Join meetings on time and test your audio/video.  
- Use a neutral background and good lighting where possible.  
- Mute when not speaking, but stay engaged — camera on when it’s your turn.  
- Prepare 1–2 key points to contribute, even if you’re not the main presenter.  
- Summarise decisions at the end if the meeting is chaotic:
  > “To confirm, the decisions are A, B, and C. I’ll send a short summary.”

This makes you the adult in the room.

## 6. Handling tension and conflict without losing face

Executives are tested most when things go wrong.

Principles:

- Own your part clearly:  
  > “Here’s what went wrong, here’s what I could have done better, here’s what I’m changing.”
- Avoid blaming colleagues in front of clients or senior leaders.  
- Offer a clear recovery plan with timelines and checkpoints.  
- Follow up proactively before you’re asked for progress.

This builds trust very fast.

## 7. Practical exercises to build executive presence

Weekly practice plan:

- **Voice & delivery**  
  - Record yourself summarising a report in 60–90 seconds.  
  - Check clarity, pace, and filler words.

- **Email discipline**  
  - Rewrite your last three long emails into 5–7 bullet points each.  
  - Use clear subjects: “Action required – Q3 budget review items”.

- **Meeting discipline**  
  - For every meeting, write your three key contributions before joining.  
  - Volunteer to summarise or present sections occasionally.

## 8. Packaging your work like a senior

Senior leaders care about:

- Impact on revenue, cost, risk, or reputation.  
- Clarity of decision options.  
- Risk awareness and mitigation planning.

So frame your updates like:

- “This reduces manual work by 25%, freeing approx. 6 staff-hours per week.”  
- “If we delay, the risk is X; my mitigation is Y.”

This is how you quietly move from “support staff” to “strategic partner”.

When you consistently combine calm delivery, clear thinking, and reliable follow-through, your executive presence grows — even before your job title changes.

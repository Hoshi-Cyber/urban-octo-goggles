keyTakeaways:
  - Executive presence is a combination of how you think, how you communicate, and how consistently you show up across CV, LinkedIn, and real-world behaviour.
  - Kenyan hiring managers look for clear business impact, not only responsibilities, when deciding who feels like leadership material.
  - Small visible habits in meetings, email, and stakeholder updates compound into a strong or weak leadership signal over time.
  - Tight, outcome-driven CV and LinkedIn narratives make it easier for interviewers to believe the presence you project in the room.

Executive presence is one of those phrases that gets used a lot in Nairobi boardrooms but rarely explained clearly.

At a basic level, it answers one question:

> “Do I trust this person to represent the organisation in bigger, more visible rooms?”

For Kenyan professionals, that decision is made long before promotion or panel interviews. It is shaped by years of small signals: how you write emails, how you speak in meetings, how your CV reads, and how your LinkedIn profile frames your story.

In this guide we will break executive presence into practical pieces you can actually work on.

## 1. Executive presence is a system, not a personality type

Many people assume executive presence is something you are born with. In practice, it is a system made of three parts:

- **Thinking** – how you frame problems, trade-offs, and impact.
- **Communication** – how you translate that thinking into clear, structured language.
- **Consistency** – how often those two show up the same way across CV, LinkedIn, meetings, and deliverables.

You do not need to become loud or extroverted. You need to become **legible**: people should quickly understand what you stand for, what you are good at, and how you make decisions.

## 2. What Kenyan hiring managers actually look for

When Kenyan hiring managers talk about “leadership material”, they are usually scanning for three things:

1. **Commercial awareness** – you understand how your work links to revenue, cost, risk, or service quality.
2. **Ownership mindset** – you take responsibility for problems instead of waiting to be told what to do.
3. **Communication under pressure** – you stay clear and structured even when things go wrong.

Your CV and LinkedIn need to show this directly. Bullets that only list duties (“Responsible for…”) make you look invisible. Bullets that show decisions and outcomes (“Reduced processing time by 32% by…”) make you look like someone who moves the needle.

## 3. Tighten your written narrative first

Before working on how you speak in meetings, fix how you look on paper and online. That is how most decision-makers encounter you first.

Focus on three assets:

### a) CV

- Lead each bullet with a **strong action verb**.
- Anchor impact with **numbers, percentages, or clear before/after statements**.
- Group achievements by **themes that match the roles you want** (growth, efficiency, risk, service quality).

### b) LinkedIn profile

- Write a headline that says **role + niche + value** – for example:  
  `Operations Manager | Retail & Distribution | Building reliable, low-waste supply chains in Kenya`.
- Use the About section to tell a short story: what you specialise in, common problems you solve, and what you are working on now.
- Add 3–5 featured items that support your story: a project, a case study, a presentation, or a short post.

### c) Internal footprint

Inside your current organisation, the same clarity should show up in:

- project updates,
- status emails,
- and performance self-reviews.

Use the same language and metrics you used on your CV. Repetition builds trust.

## 4. Upgrade how you show up in key conversations

Once the written narrative is aligned, move to how you show up live.

Pick one or two of these habits and practice them every week:

- **Lead with context.** When speaking, start with the situation and impact, then share detail.
- **Use simple structures.** For example: “There are three points we need to decide on today…” and walk through them.
- **Ask framing questions.** Instead of jumping straight to solutions, clarify the goal, constraints, and trade-offs.
- **Summarise decisions.** At the end of a discussion, quickly restate what was agreed and who owns what.

These are boring habits. They are also exactly what makes you look like the adult in the room.

## 5. Align presence across CV, LinkedIn, and the room

The strongest executive presence feels **consistent**. Your written narrative, your online brand, and your behaviour in meetings all tell the same story.

- If your CV says you lead complex projects but you never volunteer to summarise discussions, the story breaks.
- If your LinkedIn claims you drive growth but you can’t explain the numbers, the story breaks.
- If your emails are chaotic but your CV is polished, the story breaks.

Use the checklist in the frontmatter as a 30-day sprint. Each item is small, but together they significantly upgrade how others experience you.

## 6. When to bring in expert help

You can implement everything in this article on your own. However, expert help is worth considering if:

- You have already tried to fix your CV and LinkedIn several times and still get weak responses.
- You are preparing for a high-stakes move: a big promotion, relocation, or switch into senior leadership.
- You want an external partner to pressure-test your story and adjust it for the Kenyan market.

In those cases, a structured CV rewrite and LinkedIn refresh can remove months of trial and error.

The goal is simple: when someone looks at your CV, your profile, and meets you, they should say, *“This person already behaves like the level we are hiring for.”*

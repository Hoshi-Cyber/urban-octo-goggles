keyTakeaways:
  - A career switch without a pay cut is possible, but it requires a deliberate bridge between your current experience and the new field.
  - You must translate existing achievements into the language and metrics that matter in your target industry.
  - Side projects, short contracts, and internal rotations can de-risk the transition before you resign.
  - Recruiters respond best when your CV and LinkedIn clearly explain why you are changing fields and what you already know about the new space.

    - Update your LinkedIn headline and About section so they clearly state your current role, target direction, and the bridge between them.
    - Build a contact list of people already working in your target roles in Kenya and schedule at least three informational conversations in the next month.

Many professionals in Kenya want to change careers but feel trapped by their current salary band.

The fear is simple:

> “If I move into a new field, I will have to start again at entry level and take a big pay cut.”

That can happen if you jump without a plan. But with the right bridge, it is often possible to switch domains while staying close to your current compensation band.

## 1. Choose a realistic target, not a fantasy title

The first mistake is choosing roles purely by how attractive they sound – “product manager”, “strategy lead”, “data scientist” – without understanding the day-to-day work.

Pick one or two target roles and answer four questions for each:

1. What problems does this role solve for the business?
2. What metrics does it usually move? Revenue, cost, risk, churn, efficiency?
3. What skills and tools are table stakes?
4. Which of those skills do you already have evidence for?

If you cannot answer those questions, you are trying to transition into a **brand**, not a role.

## 2. Map your existing achievements to the new problems

Once you know what the new field cares about, re-read your CV.

Highlight achievements that show:

- working with similar stakeholders,
- solving related problems,
- or using transferable skills (analysis, communication, project delivery, stakeholder management).

Then rewrite those bullets using the language of the new field. For example:

- Old: “Prepared weekly sales reports for management.”
- New: “Built weekly performance dashboards that helped the sales lead track conversion, drop-off, and regional performance.”

The underlying work may be similar. The new wording makes its value visible to a hiring manager in your target field.

## 3. Build a practical bridge: projects, rotations, and contracts

Hiring managers are nervous about paying experienced-level salaries to people with zero proof in the new domain.

Your job is to create that proof through **bridges**:

- a well-scoped side project,
- a short-term consulting contract,
- an internal rotation,
- or a clearly defined stretch assignment.

The goal is not to become an expert overnight. It is to generate concrete examples you can talk about in interviews.

Document these projects properly:

- What problem were you solving?
- What was your role?
- What changed because you got involved?

Those stories become powerful material for both your CV and interviews.

## 4. Rewrite your public narrative

Your CV and LinkedIn should not look like you woke up one morning and randomly decided to change careers.

They should read like this:

1. You have a strong foundation in your current field.
2. You deliberately exposed yourself to the new domain through specific projects.
3. You now want to spend most of your time solving the types of problems that live there.

On LinkedIn:

- Use your headline to show current identity **and** direction:  
  `Finance Analyst → Transitioning into Product Analytics | Turning numbers into product decisions`.
- Use the About section to connect the dots between past and future.
- Use Featured items to highlight any projects, case studies, or public work that support the new direction.

## 5. Adjust your search strategy and negotiation stance

When you finally interview, be realistic but firm.

- You are not entitled to a huge raise in a brand-new field.
- You also do not have to accept a massive pay cut if you bring years of relevant, transferable experience.

Use your research to understand the bands for mid-level roles in the new field. Anchor your expectations there, not at entry-level.

When discussing compensation, frame it around **the value you will bring in year one**, not the number of years you have spent in the old domain.

## 6. Protect your runway

Career switches often take longer than straightforward job changes. Make sure your finances and energy can handle the longer runway:

- Build a buffer before resigning if possible.
- Avoid jumping simply to escape a bad situation without a clear landing zone.
- Use the checklist attached to this article as your execution plan over the next three to six months.

The aim is not a perfect, risk-free transition – that does not exist. The aim is an **informed** transition where your skills, narrative, and experiments all point in the same direction.

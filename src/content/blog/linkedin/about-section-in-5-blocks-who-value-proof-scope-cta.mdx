## Outcome in 30 seconds
Convert profile views into leads. Use five blocks to communicate relevance fast.

## What matters and what to ignore in Kenya

### Signal 1: introduce who you are and what you solve
One line on role and problem. First person. Present tense.

### Signal 2: articulate value, proof, and scope
Value: methods you use. Proof: metric. Scope: industries or functions.

## Steps

### Step 1: write the five blocks
- **Who** — current or target role and problem you solve  
- **Value** — methods or approach  
- **Proof** — quantified achievement  
- **Scope** — industries or functions  
- **CTA** — invite contact

### Step 2: localise with Kenya context
Use KES, sector names, counties, and relevant examples. Balance global and local language.

### Step 3: end with a clear call to action
Specify how to engage you and for what.
